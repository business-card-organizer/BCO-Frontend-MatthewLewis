# Basic Idea

    With the ever changing climate of technology, bussiness practices have to change. Bussiness cards have fallen behind the times. The premise of the app is to be a centralized collection of bussiness cards.

# Project setup
 
 [Yarn] 
    The intial project used yarn so after pulling from the master branch and creating a branch begin with:

    yarn install

    cd into bcorganizer

    yarn start

# To merge with master

    Create a pull request and add either of the Founding Reacters and we'll fix any conflict errors and decide if the change is the right direction for the app.
